In the event that the sale or rental of the Property is entrusted to a third party, it is not permitted to refer potential buyers or lessees to the third party through the content of the listing (telephone number, email, description, etc.) or through the lawn sign, otherwise the listing will be removed from the Website without refund.
Although Immolists strives to use its best efforts to keep the Website secure and maintain its integrity, Immolists MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION WHATSOEVER REGARDING THE PROPERTIES, THE VALIDITY OR ACCURACY OF THEIR DESCRIPTIONS, OR THE CAPACITY OF THE SELLERS OR LESSORS TO SELL OR RENT THEIR PROPERTIES OR OF THE BUYERS OR LESSEES TO PURCHASE OR RENT THEM.
